In the below screenshot, a table visualization is shown displaying the Employee dimension, along with the Total Including Tax measure to show each employee's total. A bar chart is also included with Employee on the X-axis and Total Including Tax on the Y-axis, sorted in descending order to highlight the highest totals. Additionally, a filter is applied using the Date dimension to enable filtering by year.

# Conclusion:
In this assignment, we used Power BI to analyze sales data from an SSAS cube and created different visualizations to help understand key sales trends:
1. Sales Performance by Employee: We looked at how much each employee sold, helping us identify the top performers based on total sales.
2. Stock Item Sales: We analyzed sales data by product category, comparing both quantity sold and the total sales amount to see which categories are doing well.
3. Sales by City: This analysis showed which cities contributed the most to sales, helping us focus on the best-performing regions.
4. Sales Trends Over Time: We tracked sales trends by month to spot patterns and understand how sales change over time.
These visualizations allowed us to filter and explore the data more easily, helping us make better decisions and understand sales performance across different dimensions.
